# OMFLOW Engine

OMFLOW is an engine that mixes business flow and IT automation flow. You can design your own forms in a WYSIWYG way, and of course you can also design your own data flow in a WYSIWYG way.\
The flow engine of OMFLOW is developed using Python+Django, which means that in addition to convenient flow design, It can also easily connect python code and community applications to achieve automation. It is very suitable for IT maintenance management and automation, as well as enterprise ERP and other applications.



## System performance

OMFLOW can be installed independently on any server of Windows or Linux, and can be interfaced with other external systems to handle related process affairs. In a general situation, the performance of a single OMFLOW is as follows:

* 10\~15 "form flow" can be created per second
* 10\~15 "form flow" can be processed per second

With the "BOOSTER system", it can work with multiple OMFLOWs to improve processing efficiency.
