# International Time Zone

From version 1.2.2 onwards, OMFLOW will **convert** according to the browser time zone when reading/storing **time data** to ensure that the database data always maintains **time zone consistency when using OMFLOW around the world. **, if you need to change the OMFLOW system time zone, please refer to the following steps:

### Modify settings.py

> Windows path: `C:\Program Files\OMFLOW Server\omflow\omflow\settings.py`
> Linux path: `/opt/omflow/server/omflow/settings.py`

Find **SERVER_TIME_ZONE = '+08:00'** and modify its time zone

```
#SERVER_TIME_ZONE
SERVER_TIME_ZONE = '+09:00'
```

### Restart service

> â€» Changing the time zone will only convert future time data and will not modify the existing time data in the database.
