# 更新Apache Server



1. Shutdown Apache.
2. Back up your current /bin and /modules folders.
3. Download new version of the same compiler and architecture.
4. Replace all files in these 2 folders with the ones from new version
5. &#x20;package.
6. Try starting Apache. It should work.
7. Optionally, you can replace the files in /include and /lib folders like you did above.

It's typically that easy to upgrade.
